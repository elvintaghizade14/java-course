# Step Project Feedback

in that part we will discuss only technical (non-functional) requirements to the project

## Naming
For repo naming, please use only small letters and numbers.
Try to use one verb/noun.
If you need two or more - split them with a dash (-).
No underscores, no capitals, no compound without delimiters.
good ones: step, step2, tinder, step-tinder, step-project-tinder
bad ones: StepProject, SS_STEP_PROJECT_TINDER, Tinder-Project
Link to the repo should be like https://gitlab.com/azsena1997/step.git
Don't do that way: 
https://github.com/farid/TinderMVP
https://github.com/Hazanzade/TinderApp/tree/master/src/main/ java/org/tinder/app
Documentation:
should be.
Readme.md file:
should contain information (goal, authors, how to run, how to deploy, etc.)
.gitignore file:
Extra files in the repo (.idea/, classes/, etc)
